World Vision believes that our digital offerings should be accessible to all users, including people with disabilities.  We strive for a high level of compliance (level A) with the WCAG 2.0 guidelines where possible.


Web accessibility refers to the inclusive practice of making websites usable by people of all abilities and disabilities. When sites are correctly designed, developed and edited, all users can have equal access to information and functionality.

The needs that Web accessibility aims to address include:
* Visual
* Motor/Mobility
* Auditory
* Seizures
* Cognitive/Intellectual

In 1999 the Web Accessibility Initiative, a project by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), published the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG 1.0. In recent years, these have been widely accepted as the definitive guidelines on how to create accessible websites.  On 11 December 2008, the WAI released the WCAG 2.0 as a Recommendation. WCAG 2.0 aims to be up to date and more technology neutral.

### Web Content Accessibility Guidlines 2.0 Checklist
* Text Alternatives: Provide text alternatives (such as alt tags and descriptions for images) for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.
* Time-based Media: Provide alternatives for time-based media.
* Adaptable: Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure.
* Distinguishable: Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.
* Keyboard Accessible: Make all functionality available from a keyboard.
* Enough Time: Provide users enough time to read and use content.
* Seizures: Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures.
* Navigable: Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.
* Readable: Make text content readable and understandable. Appropriate font size and color.
* Predictable: Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.
* Input Assistance: Help users avoid and correct mistakes.
