* Error messages should appear within view (not above or below the fold)
* The page should jump to the point on the page where the first error occurs (except when validating fields inline)
* Use strong colors as appropriate to make the error stand out
* Error messages should appear just below the entry field of each error, not at the top of the page
* The field with the error should be highlighted, and the user should be instructed what needs correction
* Error messages should be clearly written in language that makes sense to the average user
* Don’t blame the user, help them by telling them what to do to fix it
* Inline validation per field (vs. on submit) is best when possible
* Some fields may be left empty because users don't want to provide the information
* Be clear which fields are required
