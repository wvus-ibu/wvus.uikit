World Vision has only one logo. No other logo or graphic mark may be used to advertise, market, or communicate a World Vision product or project.

All of the graphic elements (horizon, logotype, cross/star, white background, and registration mark) must always be shown together as displayed here. None of the constituent elements of the logo may be shown separately in any context.

### Logo use

* The World Vision logo must always be reproduced from the original .eps vector or original .jpg bitmap artwork. Never recreate the World Vision logo.
* The World Vision logo should always appear in the upper left corner of the website, with the horizontal tagline "lock-up".
* When the World Vision logo is used on external sites, the logo should always link to [worldvision.org](http://www.worldvision.org).
* The World Vision logo must always appear on a solid white background.
* The World Vision logo must always have adequate "padding" around the edges. Use the measurements below to ensure adequate protected space between the logo and any surrounding text or images.
