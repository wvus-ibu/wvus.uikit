### 12-column grid

Every page on the World Vision website is 940 px wide and laid out within a 12 column grid. Each column has a width size of 60 px with a 20 px gutter between each column. Page elements should be sized and laid out to fit within these boundaries.  Flexibility of layout is encouraged so long as all elements fit within the grid.

<span class="label label-info">FYI:</span> An example with code can be found [here]({{ page.path}}{{ site.developerdocs }}/grid/basic)

#### Example

Below is an example showing a page using the grid.
