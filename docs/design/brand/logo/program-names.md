**World Vision has one logo. Any program name with a specific graphic treatment or icon is secondary to the World Vision logo.**

Under the WVI Logo Development Policy, there is no allowance for the development and use of icons/symbols/logos that would be used to distinguish departments within the World Vision partnership. *Program names* (e.g. Artist Associates, Speaker’s Bureau, etc.) should be used in the same manner as they are used offline. There must be a clear use of the program name near the title of the web page or micro-site.

Products and programs should be communicated in text, using the corporate font Gill Sans. Program names must include “World Vision” as part of the text, and may only use colors found in the World Vision color palette.

Microsites or websites featuring graphic text treatments of program names must include the official World Vision logo, which should be at least half the size of the program name. The World Vision logo must be linked to [www.worldvision.org](www.WorldVision.org).
