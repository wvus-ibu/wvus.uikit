World Vision UiKit
===================

This self-containing kit is the basis of World Vision US website styling.

### Getting Started

2. Extract the contents
3. Link `css/wvus.uikit.all.min.css` in the `head` of the site. 
4. For a responsive design, also link `css/wvus.uikit.all.responsive.min.css` after `wvus.uikit.all.min.css`
