Although the World Vision corporate identity calls for Gill Sans as the corporate typeface, rendering the font as html text may not always be possible. In these cases, Arial has been selected as the substitute font for Web page content. In situations where text can be applied over a graphic or background, corporate identity standards apply. Gill Sans should be used in these instances.

Text should be rendered in HTML in most cases, except where specifically noted.

**Text applied to an image**
* Never cover the subjectâ€™s face
* Take care not to overpower the photo
* Text applied to an image should never be smaller than 16 px font
* Bold and italics can be used at the discretion of the designer

**Size and color**

Homepage Typography:
For consistency, each instance of HTML text on the homepage have an assigned size and color.
